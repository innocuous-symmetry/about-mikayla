        <section>
            <h2>Create full stack web applications</h2>
            <p>I have experience building web applications with and without back-end integrations.</p>
            <p>I am comfortable conceptualizing and organizing complex structures, and as such, my projects tend to be natural in their structure and easy to maintain.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Database Operations and Management</h2>
            <p>My projects have featured both relational and non-relational databases, in particular PostgreSQL and MongoDB.</p>
            <p>I also have experience with various technologies for connecting these to front-end applications, including Prisma and Supabase.</p>
