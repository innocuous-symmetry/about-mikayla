        <p>I would be remiss not to take the opportunity to speak about how I feel my experience as a musician informs my work as a developer.</p>
        <p>Working as a musician helped me to develop invaluable skills that provide me with a unique frame of reference in regards to my approach to technical problems.</p>
        <p>See below some of the relevant applications of my musical experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modular synthesis, which heavily involves fundamentals of arithmetic and data flow</li>
            <li>Orchestration; ensuring all instrumental parts are executable and comfortable to play within a given set of parameters</li>
            <li>Learning to play new instruments, and adapt my pre-existing knowledge to apply to new frames of reference</li>
            <li>Audio engineering, and the associated practices of learning/using music technology</li>
            <li>Proper interaction of related components within a larger context</li>
            <li>Conceptualizing long-form, well-designed structures</li>
            <li>Managing proportional integrity in musical forms</li>
        </ul>
